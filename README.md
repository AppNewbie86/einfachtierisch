Community for Dogfriends

Hello dear readers

This project is my final exam as an Android Junior Developer and the topic was my personal heart's 
desire to develop an app where dog lovers and dog owners can get in contact and write to each other, arrange meetings or everything else 
that concerns the dog and of course a feature for dog sponsorship where you can only support that dog and his family if a situation may require it

Implemented Features

Facebook
Instagram
Github


you can log in and register in the app, after that you get to a 
dashboard where the rest of the navigation 
takes over You can add a new request where other users can see and comment on it!
